                        <h3>Project Overview</h3>
                        <p>This web application uses machine learning to predict the likelihood of liver cirrhosis based on clinical test results. The model was trained on a comprehensive dataset of liver function tests and patient outcomes.</p>


                        <h3>About the Application</h3>
                        <p>This tool uses a Random Forest model trained on the Indian Liver Patient Dataset to predict liver cirrhosis stages. Input clinical parameters to get instant, data-driven insights.</p>

                        <h3 class="mt-4">How It Works</h3>
                        <p>The prediction system uses a Random Forest classifier that was trained on the following features:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Patient age</li>
                            <li>Total Bilirubin levels</li>
                            <li>Direct Bilirubin levels</li>
                            <li>Alkaline Phosphotase levels</li>
                            <li>Alamine Aminotransferase levels</li>
                            <li>Aspartate Aminotransferase levels</li>
                            <li>Total Proteins</li>
                            <li>Albumin levels</li>
                            <li>Albumin and Globulin Ratio</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="mt-4">Model Performance</h3>
                        <p>The Random Forest model achieves an accuracy of approximately 68% on the test dataset. While not perfect, it provides valuable insights that can assist healthcare professionals in early detection.</p>
